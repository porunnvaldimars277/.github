Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an experienced developer with a strong background in full-stack development. I primarily work with JavaScript and Python, and I harness the power of modern frameworks, libraries, and tools to build highly scalable and efficient applications. 

My tech stack includes:

- **Languages**: JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Ruby
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: React, Node.js, Express, Django
- **Databases**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Webpack, VS Code

I have experience in Agile methodologies and have collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutions. My passion lies in clean code and best practices, and I continuously seek to improve my skills through learning and experimentation.

Apart from development, I am also interested in contributing to open-source projects and mentoring junior developers. I believe in the power of community and collaboration, and I enjoy sharing knowledge with others.
